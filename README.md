##Â [Dominoes](https://hyperskill.org/projects/146?)
I created a Python-based Dominoes game as part of a project on JetBrains Academy. This project was an engaging way to dive into basic programming concepts like strings, tuples, lists, and conditional statements. The game pits the player against the computer, leveraging simple AI and basic statistics to simulate decision-making. Throughout this project, I focused on developing a user-friendly interface, implementing game rules, and managing turn-based gameplay, which provided a solid foundation for more advanced programming tasks.
